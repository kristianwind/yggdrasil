# Security audit & hardening

Audit performed 2026-06-08 (5 parallel reviewers: auth/RBAC, injection/files, secrets/crypto,
container privilege, web/network). Trust model: single-admin homelab, but runes are imported
from GitHub (semi-trusted) and apps are exposed publicly (Cloudflare/NPM), so privilege and
injection findings matter.

## Status

### ✅ Pass 1A — shipped v0.2.78
- **Rune privilege allowlist** (`internal/gameskill/schema.go` `validate()`): `capabilities`,
  `devices`, `sysctls`, and `extra_volumes` targets restricted to a conservative allowlist
  (caps: NET_ADMIN/NET_RAW/NET_BIND_SERVICE/SYS_NICE; devices: /dev/net/tun,/dev/dri,/dev/fuse;
  sysctls: a few net.*; extra_volumes may not shadow /usr,/bin,/etc,…). Enforced at the single
  Parse chokepoint (upload **and** runtime load), so a malicious rune is refused both ways.
- **Admin-gate rune endpoints** (`server.go`): upload/import-egg/import-xml/github-browse/
  install-from-github/delete now `requireAdmin` (were any-authenticated → priv-esc path).
- **Block built-in rune overwrite** (`handleUploadGameskill`): refuse upserting over a
  `builtin=1` rune (anti-backdoor).
- **Root command injection fixed** (`repairDataPerms`): user path was interpolated via `%q`
  (double quotes leave `$()`/backticks active) into a root `/bin/sh -c`; now shell-single-quoted.

### ✅ Pass 2 #1 (Auth) — shipped v0.2.79
- **Live session re-validation**: `authMiddleware` now re-checks the JWT against the DB every
  request — `disabled` users and role changes take effect immediately (the live role is used,
  not the token's). `users.token_version` column + `ver` JWT claim; a mismatch = revoked.
- **Real logout / revocation**: logout, and any password/role/disabled change, bump
  `token_version` → all of that user's existing tokens are invalidated.
- **Per-account login lockout**: 10 failed attempts/15 min locks a username for 15 min,
  independent of source IP (defeats `X-Forwarded-For` rotation). The per-IP limiter map is now
  swept to bound memory.

### ✅ Pass 2 #4 (Web) — shipped v0.2.80
- **CSP** (`default-src 'self'`, `script-src 'self'`, `frame-ancestors 'none'`, …) + **HSTS**
  (only when served over HTTPS, so plain-HTTP LAN access isn't force-upgraded and locked out).
- **WebSocket same-origin check** (`CheckOrigin` now compares Origin host to the request host)
  — blocks cross-site WebSocket hijacking of the console; non-browser clients (no Origin) pass.
- **CORS**: `AllowCredentials` off (no cookie reflection cross-origin); tokenless Bearer API use
  still allowed.
- **Cross-origin mutation block**: state-changing requests with a mismatched Origin are rejected
  (defense-in-depth behind SameSite=Strict; Bearer automation sends no Origin and passes).

### ✅ Pass 2 #5 + #6 (Files + Runtime) — shipped v0.2.81
- **safeJoin** now resolves symlinks (nearest existing ancestor) and re-checks the result stays
  in the data dir — a symlink planted inside can't be used to read/write host files.
- **Backup restore** rejects symlink entries whose target escapes the destination (zip-slip via
  symlink) and opens files with `O_NOFOLLOW`.
- **PidsLimit (8192)** on all runtime + install containers — caps process count so a fork bomb in
  one server can't exhaust the host PID table.

### ✅ Pass 2 #3 + #7 (Secrets + Misc) — shipped v0.2.82
- **RCON password masked** in the server GET response (sentinel `••••••••`); the update handler
  treats the sentinel as "keep existing", so the edit form round-trips without leaking or
  clobbering it. (No longer echoed to ServerView holders.)
- **BattleMetrics token encrypted at rest** (was plaintext in app_settings); legacy plaintext
  still readable.
- **TOTP replay protection**: a 2FA code (or earlier step) already accepted is rejected
  (`users.totp_last_counter`), so an observed code can't be reused inside its window. With the
  per-account lockout from #1, 2FA brute force is now bounded too.
- **crypto fail-closed**: `crypto.New` rejects a secret < 16 chars (SHA-256 of a trivial secret is
  a known value), and the server refuses to start rather than running with a weak/known key.

### ⏳ Pass 2 #2 (Transport) — accepted / deferred, with rationale
- **NPM** is reached over plain `http://…:81` here, so `InsecureSkipVerify` is moot for it.
- **UniFi** is a self-signed LAN appliance and **SFTP** host-key pinning would be TOFU; both are
  LAN-path MITM risks only, fiddly to pin, and untestable here. Documented as accepted for the
  homelab; cert/host-key pinning is a future enhancement (store a fingerprint in the encrypted
  config and verify it).

### ⏳ Still open (lower priority, by design)
- **Startup-command env injection**: `{{TEMPLATED}}` env values flow into `/bin/sh -c`. Naive
  shell-quoting breaks runes that word-split (e.g. `JAVA_OPTS`), so it needs a per-rune-tested
  fix (prefer `startup.exec`; validate env keys; quote only where safe). Bounded today: it
  requires `server.control`, which already implies console access to that container.
- **Env-at-rest encryption**: non-RCON secret env vars are still stored plaintext in `env_json`
  (RCON is now masked in responses). Full encryption is a migration with corruption risk; the
  main leak (RCON password echoed to ServerView) is closed.
- **`?token=` query-param auth** on WebSocket handshakes (lands in proxy logs) — kept for
  browser WS which can't set headers; mitigated by the WS same-origin check.
- **`server.control` can edit env/subdomain** — consider a dedicated `server.edit` perm.

### ✅ Pass 3 — shipped v0.2.84 (re-audit, 3 parallel reviewers)
A second review after passes 1–2, focused on the per-server delegated-permission
boundary (the panel now leans on it for non-admin users). Findings fixed:
- **Install-log WebSocket RBAC** (`handlers_install.go`): `GET /api/servers/{id}/install/log`
  streamed build output (mod ids, paths, sometimes credential-bearing env) with no
  per-server check — any authenticated user could read another server's log. Now gated on
  `ServerView` for that specific server, before the WS upgrade (matches `handleServerLogs`).
- **Domain-probe SSRF** (`handlers_domains.go`): the reachability probe derived its target
  from `servers.subdomain`, which a `server.control` holder can edit, and a dotted value is
  probed verbatim — so it could be aimed at `169.254.169.254`/localhost/LAN with status-code
  reflection. `probeDomain` now dials through `guardedDial`, which resolves and rejects
  loopback/private/link-local/metadata IPs **at connect time** (also closes DNS-rebinding);
  the `InsecureSkipVerify` cert-retry reuses the same guard.
- **Realm CRUD admin-gate** (`server.go`): realm create/update/delete were authenticated-only —
  a non-admin could rename/delete a realm (a permission scope), detaching its servers and
  silently stripping other delegates' realm-scoped grants. Now `requireAdmin`; list stays
  read-only (the create-server form needs it).
- **Builtin-rune overwrite guard** (`handlers_gameskills.go`, `handlers_runes_github.go`): the
  anti-backdoor guard only covered direct upload; egg-import, xml-import, and github-install
  could overwrite a builtin on an id collision. Shared `isBuiltinRune()` now guards all four.

## Confirmed good
argon2id password hashing; API tokens stored only as SHA-256 hash; parameterized SQL throughout;
no docker.sock mount and runes can't request it; `extra_volumes` host source confined to the
data dir; no privileged/host-net/host-pid; GitHub rune fetch host-restricted; RBAC otherwise
consistent (server/file/backup/schedule handlers resolve the real target, no IDOR); login cookie
is HttpOnly + **SameSite=Strict** (load-bearing — do not relax without Origin checks).
